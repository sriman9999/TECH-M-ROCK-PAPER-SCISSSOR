INTRODUCTION:
The Rock-Paper-Scissors game project is a React Native application designed to provide users with an interactive gaming experience. Inspired by the classic hand game, this project offers a digital rendition of the timeless Rock-Paper-Scissors gameplay, allowing users to compete against a computer opponent.
Built using React Native, the project utilizes state management and animation features to create a dynamic and engaging user interface. Players can make their choices among rock, paper, or scissors, and the game determines the winner based on the classic rules of the game.

Key features of the project include:
•	Interactive Gameplay: Users can select their choice of hand gesture (rock, paper, or scissors) to compete against the computer.
•	Real-time Results: The game displays the outcome of each round in real-time, indicating whether the user wins, loses, or draws against the computer opponent.
•	Animated Transitions: The project incorporates animation effects to smooth transitions between game states, enhancing the user experience.
•	Responsive Design: Designed with responsiveness, the application adapts to different screen sizes and orientations, ensuring a seamless gaming experience across various devices.
Combining traditional gameplay elements with modern technology, the Rock-Paper-Scissors project offers users a fun and nostalgic gaming experience accessible from their mobile devices. Whether seeking a quick diversion or engaging in friendly competition, users can enjoy the timeless appeal of Rock-Paper-Scissors in a digital format.

STEPS INVOLVED IN PROJECTS:
Creating a React Native Project:
•	First, a folder for the React Native project was created. This is where all project-related files and directories will be stored.
•	Within this folder, the project was initialized using Expo CLI. The command ‘npx create-expo-app AwesomeProject’ creates a new Expo project named "AwesomeProject". This command sets up a basic project structure with necessary dependencies and configurations.
Navigating to the Project Directory:
After creating the project, the terminal navigated into the newly created project directory using the ‘cd AwesomeProject’ command. This step is crucial to perform actions within the project directory.
Starting the Expo Development Server:
•	With the project directory as the current working directory, the Expo development server was started using ‘npx expo start’. This command launches the Expo CLI, which starts the development server responsible for serving the project files and managing the development workflow.

Creating Components:
•	Several components were created within the project. Each component serves a specific purpose in the application:
•	RockPaper.js: Component responsible for managing the Rock-Paper-Scissors game logic.
•	Actions.js: Component handling user actions within the game, such as making a choice.
•	Header.js: Component rendering the header of the application, possibly containing the title or branding.
•	DisplayResult.js: Component displaying the result of each game round.
•	Main.js: A possible entry point or main component of the application.
•	App.js: The main file where the components are typically imported and organized.

Starting the Project:
•	After creating the components and setting up the project files, the project was started using npm start. This command initiates the development server and launches the application, allowing developers to view and interact with it in a development environment.
Viewing Output using Expo Go:
•	Expo Go is an app available on iOS and Android devices that allows developers to preview and test their Expo projects on real devices.
•	To view the project output, a QR code is typically displayed in the terminal after starting the development server.
•	By scanning this QR code using the Expo Go app on a mobile device, developers can view the project output in real time on their device, facilitating testing and debugging.

TOOLS USED:
•	Expo CLI: Expo CLI is a command-line tool for creating, managing, and running Expo projects. It simplifies the React Native development process by providing a set of pre-configured tools and libraries, as well as a development server for previewing projects on real devices.
•	Node Package Manager (npm): npm is a package manager used to install, manage, and update project dependencies. It is essential for managing the various libraries and modules required for React Native development.
•	Visual Studio Code (VS Code): VS Code is a popular code editor widely used for React Native development. It offers features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, debugging, and extensions that enhance the development experience.
•	Expo Go App: Expo Go is a mobile app on iOS and Android platforms. It lets developers preview and test their Expo projects directly on real devices. Developers can scan the QR code generated by the Expo development server to load and run their projects on Expo Go.
